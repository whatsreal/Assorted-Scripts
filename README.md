# Assorted-Scripts
These are my assorted scripts and other things I use to make life easier. I have them organized by which computer environment they come from. the rPi folder is from my Raspberry Pi. The Laptop folder are from my current laptop, a macbook pro.

## Raspberry Pi

### Check IP
Small script that emails me if my external IP has changed. I have my router set up to pass through a port for SSH. I don't need it often, so an occasional email updating me on the ip is fine. 

Note: Add email and password to the appropriate fields in the script. I have set a cron job to run every 10 minutes (*/10 * * * *).

## Laptop

### Emacs Configuration
This is a fork off of Bozhidar Batsov's Prelude project (https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude) personalized for my own academic purposes. I have changed LaTeX integration as well as updated some org-mode features for my own purposes.
